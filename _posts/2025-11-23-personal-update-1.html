title: Personal Update 1
---
 <p>Since anyone who read my post detailing my health journey was able to find this blog at least once, I decided that this would be a good place to provide updates. I’ve even rebranded the blog to reflect this (as you can see at the top of each page). Here’s the first installment.</p>
<p>I have been undergoing treatment since that post. I completed 30 radiation treatments concurrent with oral Chemotherapy meds over the course of 7 weeks. <p>I tolerated treatment well; I only barfed once. :–)</p>
<img src="/202511_headshot.jpeg" srcset="/images/202511_headshot@2x.jpeg 2x" alt=" selfie taken by Anthony on 2025, November 23; yes, I did need a haircut for the areas where it was still growing, but the right side of my head is notably thin on hair, which is more conspicuous in person."/>
<p>I did have hair loss as expected, both a general thinning out of my very robust mop and significant balding around the radiation site on the right side of my head. Lack of appetite was another side effect of treatment. I regained a few kg since returning to Calgary, but I lost most of those gains during treatment. At least I have stabilized, even if it’s not an ideal baseline. I just completed a 4-week break in treatment and my body recovered enough to go ahead with the next stage of treatment. That plan consists of six cycles of Chemo: of five consecutive days of oral medications (at double the dose I had during radiation) followed by 23 days without treatment.<a href="#foot1" id="ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> I’ve started the first cycle and so far no problems. </p>
<p>Just before I start each new cycle, I will meet with a medical oncologist to confirm that my lab results are looking good enough that I can proceed to the next cycle.</p>
<p>I have started rehearsing with <a href="https://foothillsconcertband.ca" target="_blank">my community concert band</a> again. I’ll be conducting one piece on the December concert, and then about half the pieces for the remaining concerts this season, ending in June (health permitting, of course; that caveat is inferred these days). It has been energizing to get back to music! As a bonus, my psychologist pointed out that music helps rebuild pathways in the brain, so it’s healing as well. </p>
<p>I still have the same amount of vision loss, but my brain is doing a better job of interpreting the data going in. Some of the distortions I saw shortly after surgery have normalized. Still, I struggle using my devices, heavily utilizing dictation software and screen reader software built into the operating systems of my devices.<a href="#foot2" id="ref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> I have a gorgeous 27-inch Display in front of me while I compose this, but I can only focus on small chunks of the screen at a time, and have real trouble reading back what the dictation software has just captured. Similarly, I can’t read music at a glance as I used to be able to do, so that means I have to memorize the scores I will be conducting in band. I’m starting with ones that I am very familiar with and will branch out when I can.</p>
<p>I have made a point of getting out for coffee or lunch dates with friends and colleagues, and I am grateful for the help others have provided to create some of these gatherings and get me a ride there and back. These activities also energize me.</p>
<p>In general, I move around in the world more slowly, mostly because of the vision loss; depth perception and motion detection are an issue. Luckily, I have decades of practice being cautious. I try to limit myself to one event or significant task per day, lest I become exhausted. Daily naps are a given.</p>
<p>If you spend time with me, you’ll see that I am still me… and still loquacious. My energy level rises whenever we talk about a favourite topic of mine. I live for those moments. As I said in the initial blog post about my health adventure, you can feel free to reach out to me directly</p>
