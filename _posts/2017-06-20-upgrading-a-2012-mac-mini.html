title: Upgrading a 2012 Mac mini
---
<p>I've been using my Mac mini Server (Late 2012) for some time now in a RAID 0 configuration (2 internal 1 TB hard drives, showing up in the Finder as a single 2&nbsp;TB volume). When my hardware at work was upgraded from a Late 2012 Mac mini (single HD) to a Late 2014 Mac mini with a Fusion drive, I noticed a significant performance upgrade. Since some aspects of the Late 2014 model were not as good as the 2012 model (mostly 2 vs. 4 processor cores), I attributed the performance bump to the presence of an internal SSD.</p>
<p>Since I was taking up less than 700&nbsp;GB of space on the internal drives of my Mac at home, I could afford to remove one of the two 1 TB hard drives, at least with regards to the amount of storage I needed. I knew I could create a Fusion Drive on my Mac mini so long as there was one internal SSD and one hard drive, so I decided to do that to improve my performance. This article documents the most effective way I found to do so and the resources I used, providing additional details along the way that would have been helpful to me.</p>
<h2>What You Need</h2>
<ul>
    <li>A Mac mini (2011 or 2012) with two internal hard drives configured as a RAID (it's certainly possible to upgrade your single drive Mac mini to a Fusion Drive, but it requires an extra drive mounting kit and many more steps, so it will not be discussed here)</li>
    <li>External storage for backups with at least the capacity of your two internal drives (in my case, I needed at least 2&nbsp;TB)</li>
    <li>A bootable disk/volume with Disk Utility and Terminal (it could be a Recovery partition if need be, but it can't be the main boot volume of the Mac mini — even a USB boot volume created by TechTool Pro or DeployStudio would suffice)</li>
    <li>2.5" SATA Solid State Drive (I chose a 250&nbsp;GB <a href="http://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/ssd/product/consumer/850evo.html" target="_blank">Samsung SSD 850 EVO</a>)</li>
    <li>Torx T6, Torx T8, and 2.0 mm Hex screwdrivers (I had a 15-piece set from The Source that is no longer available, but you could choose the NewerTech 11-piece set, which also has a pry tool that could be handy)</li>
    <li>A static-free work surface (at work, I have an anti-static mat and a wrist strap, but at home I had to settle for a wood table on a wood floor with something grounded nearby to regularly discharge static; the OWC web site has <a href="http://www.macsales.com/static" target="_blank">a very informative page on static</a> that I recommend you read)</li>
    <li><cite>Optional:</cite> External 2.5" drive enclosure (so that you can repurpose the hard drive that gets removed; I chose a <a href="http://www.vantecusa.com/products_detail.php?p_id=31&p_name=NexStar+6G&pc_id=2&pc_name=3.5%22+Enclosure&pt_id=1&pt_name=Hard+Drive+Enclosures" target="_blank">Vantec NexStar 6G USB 3.0 enclosure</a> with which I have had good success at work).</li>
    <li><cite>Optional:</cite> A current macOS Installer (e.g., Install macOS Sierra)</li>
    <li><cite>Optional:</cite> <a href="https://github.com/magervalp/autodmg" target="_blank">AutoDMG</a>, the Open Source software tool from Per Olafsson that modularly creates a bootable macOS volume in a disk image, suitable for block-coping</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Backup all the things. Redundantly.</h2>
    <p><strong></strong><br />I use Time Machine for my day-to-day backup using a Time Capsule on our home network. I also periodically make a full backup of my boot drive using Disk Utility, which I then store off site. I made certain both of those were current. Specifically:
        <ol>
            <li>From the Time Machine menu extra (or from System Preferences > Time Machine), select Backup Now and wait until the backup completes.</li>
            <li>Boot from an external drive with Disk Utility, open Disk Utility, select the RAID volume from the Mac mini in the left sidebar and then select File > New Image > Image from [Name of my RAID volume] or press Command-Option-N. Store the image on an external drive. When the image of your boot drive is complete, then scan that image file so that it can be restored (Image > Scan Image for Restore…).</li>
        </ol>
    As it turned out, I ended up adding a third backup. If you don't have the disk image routine that I already have for off site backups, you'll want to use this instead, especially since you can boot from it in case things fall apart somewhere and you need to get back to work:
        <ol start=3>
            <li>Boot from an external drive with Disk Utility, open Disk Utility, select in the left sidebar a blank volume/partition (at least 2&nbsp;TB in size in this case) on an external drive, and ask to Restore the RAID volume to it (Edit > Restore or Command-Shift-R, and then select the internal RAID volume). <strong>Read the dialogue box carefully,</strong> making certain you erase the blank disk and <em>not</em> your source RAID volume.</li>
        </ol>
    Many will recommend that you should have three distinct backups. I can't argue with that.
    </p>

<h2>Step 2: Perform Mac mini Surgery</h2>
<p>Swapping in the new SSD for the old hard drive is slightly tricky, but I found it to be manageable — and this is from someone who is more software-oriented than hardware-oriented. By far the easiest way to do this is to <a href="https://eshop.macsales.com/installvideos/mac_mini2012_hd/" target="_blank">follow the instructions in the OWC video on replacing the drive on a Mac mini with a single drive installed.</a> Use the instructions for the single drive model because you will only be replacing the first (and easiest) drive, and as such should not need to do special handstands like moving the logic board (as is necessary if you are replacing both drives). If you'd prefer a list of steps in text, <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Mac+Mini+Late+2012+Hard+Drive+Replacement/11716" target="_blank">iFixIt also has a guide.</a></p>
<p>A couple of notes from my experience doing the swap:
<ul>
    <li>Reconnecting the WiFi connector is a lot harder than it looks, especially if your Mac mini has that flap in the way. Take some time when disassembling to see the position you will need to replicate. In the end, I finally got it aligned with the help of a small screwdriver (which also held back the flap). Once I had it aligned, I removed the screwdriver and pressed down on the flap and connector, giving me the best vertical alignment when pressing down. (My earlier attempts were always at an angle slightly off vertical and would not connect.)</li>
    <li>My replacement SSD was much thinner than the hard drive it replaced. When you screw in the two Torx 8 screws into the grate holding the WiFi hardware (about 6 minutes in to the OWC video), the screws are meant to be received by the drive you just installed. In my case, there was enough play there that it would not catch reliably. I ended up flipping the Mac mini to its normal upright position so that gravity would cause the SSD to rest on the grate. I could then hold the Mac mini in the air and insert those two screws from underneath, successfully connecting with the screw holes on the SSD.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 3: Create the Fusion Drive</h2>
<p><cite>Note: There is no turning back once you start this step. The data from the original RAID will be destroyed.</cite></p>
<p>We need to boot from an external drive. I had a OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) boot drive handy, so I chose that. Just to give you the lay of the land, here's what the drive setup looked like in Disk Utility (10.10 version) before we created the Fusion Drive:</p>
