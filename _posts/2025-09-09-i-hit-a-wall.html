title: I Hit a Wall
---

<h3>2025 July 17 (Thursday)</h3>
<p>Day 3 of the 2025 <a href="https://macadmins.psu.edu" target="_blank">MacAdmins Conference</a> was coming to a close, with the day’s final event being a live audience recording of <a href="https://podcast.macadmins.org/2025/07/29/episode-422-live-from-macadmins-at-penn-state/" target="_blank"> the Mac Admins Podcast.</a> I was walking by the washrooms near Dean’s Hall 1 and 2 on my way to the event when I hit a wall. No, I don’t mean that feeling when the intensity of a multi-day conference or event catches up to you and it becomes necessary to grab a nap and/or take a session off in order to regroup for the rest of the conference. I mean it literally.</p>

<p>In that section of the  Penn Stater Conference Center, there were decorative part-walls perpendicular to the washrooms. The walls narrowed that part of the hallway, but still left a pretty wide berth. Not wide enough, apparently, as I found myself walking into one of them at my usual brisk pace (5–6 km/h), with my forehead above my left eye taking the brunt of it. I hit the wall squarely enough that I didn’t fall down, it just stopped me cold. Shocked, I then took myself to the floor to recover. Since it may be hard to visualize what happened, and I don’t have any photos of the area in question, I did this reenactment outside of the hospital at which I would later spend a fair bit of time:</p>

<h3>Sidebar — Names</h3>
<p>I’ve decided not to name names as I tell the rest of the story because I learned through this situation that the Mac Admins community is strong — even vociferous — in its support of people in the community. It was circumstantial which specific people helped me. I am truly grateful for those who stepped up that day and over the subsequent days and weeks — it meant a lot to me at the time and still does today — but I also recognize that had I done things even five minutes earlier or later, a different set of people would have stepped up and helped. It was — and <em>is</em> — incredibly heartwarming.</p>
<h3>Where was I? Oh yes…</h3>
<p>After hitting the wall,  I was offered help but the only help I took immediately was a quick visual concussion assessment by the nearby hotel registration desk attendant who had sports medicine training. I decided to go back to my hotel room and rest for a while instead. I was told to go to the conference registration desk or just grab a conference organizer for help if I changed my mind. On the way to the hotel room, I entered the elevator and my left wrist and Apple Watch glanced off the side of the elevator entrance. (Retrospectively, this is another sign that I now had an issue with navigating around things on  my left side.) Once in the hotel room, I contacted my wife at home in Calgary. She wisely suggested I call the number for my work travel insurance. I got confirmation from insurance that I could get assessed and only needed to contact them again if I needed to be admitted. I decided  to go back down to the courtyard level. My quick online research revealed that there was one nearby hospital and some urgent care centres, but the latter seemed to close at 8 or 9 p.m. and it was now around 8:30. The people at the hotel front desk told me to just go to the hospital, the Mount Nittany Medical Center. I tried a couple of things to get a ride but I was a little impatient, so I went where I knew I would see people: Legends, the hotel lounge that participants frequented. “I need a ride to the hospital. Who has a vehicle and hasn’t been drinking?” As I mentioned earlier, the response was immediate. Someone I knew <em>of</em> but didn’t know drove and someone I knew well came along for support. In a few minutes, we arrived at the Mount Nittany Medical Center.</p>
<h3>Diagnosis: Stroke?</h3>
<p>Once I was triaged, it didn’t take that long to get seen by a doctor. When I failed the “touch your nose, then touch my finger” test on my left side, a CT Scan<a href="#foot1" id="ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> was next. As I learned later, they initially suspected a stroke since it only affected one side of my body. But I always passed the other stroke tests (“pull on my fingers, now push, resist when I push down on your leg, now push your foot against my hand”…). As it turned out, the CT Scan showed that there was a mass in my brain — a brain tumour. It had caused  significant peripheral vision loss in my left eye  — a visual field cut that meant I couldn’t see any object to the left of my left eyeball if I was staring straight ahead. And yet, my brain told me that I had a full field of vision. The best way I can describe it is that it’s like if you used an image editing program (like Photoshop) to remove an object from the scene — in this case, a wall or pillar. The main difference, as I have discovered over time, is that it compresses the scene horizontally rather than filling the void created with  an approximated background. Fonts look slightly narrower on the horizontal axis, kind of like your 16:9 aspect ratio TV changed to 14:9. As well, my distance vision has a bit of a soft focus or filter effect, like glamour photography. People look younger and slightly thinner, especially on screens, where you might look 10–20 years younger to me! Regardless, there is a large chunk of stuff that I simply couldn’t see unless I turned my head or body to look at it directly.</p>
<p>They also did a CT Scan of my chest because when you get this kind of tumour in your brain, 9 out of 10 times it is a cancerous growth that has migrated from a different part of your body. As later tests confirmed, this was the 1-out-of-10 case: a primary brain tumour. So I was basically healthy except for this one little problem.</p>
<p>This meant that I would need to be admitted to hospital — and not the one I was in. I was told that I had to select between two hospitals (one clearly a corporate hospital, something we really don‘t have 
at home). Both of them were over an hour away. The staff said they worked with one of them all the time, so once I called my insurance company again to confirm that the Hershey Medical Center was “in their network” and that they would support getting me admitted there, the next part of my adventure was in motion. The people who brought me to the hospital generously offered to pack up my hotel room and bring my bags to the Mount Nittany so that they could be transferred with me when I made the trip to the Hershey Medical Center. I didn’t have to check out of the hotel, since this would have been my last night anyway and they had auto checkout. Once I let my wife know what was happening, she cancelled my flight home out of State College, rapidly made arrangements with her network of friends to take care of things at home (read: our high-needs miniature poodle), and booked her flights to join me.</p>
<p>It was a busy enough night for ambulances in the area that there wasn’t one available to transport me to Hershey, I would need to wait until mid-morning the next day before being transferred. My case was described as being important but not urgent. The rest of the day was mostly uneventful.</p>
<h3>2025 July 18 (Friday)</h3>
<p>I was loaded up in the transfer ambulance shortly after 10 a.m. and was informed I would be admitted and placed directly in my hospital room upon arrival. With no need for sirens blaring, I arrived at the Hershey Medical Center at about 12:10 p.m., just about the time people at the conference were having their final meal before making their way home. It would be another three weeks before that was the case for me.</p>
<p>I spend the rest of the day mostly resting and awaiting testing (the MRI became available after midnight, for instance). I had a nice visit from a couple of Mac Admins driving home after the conference. I even listened to the radio broadcast  of a Canadian Football League game as I waited. In a text exchange in the early evening, my wife asked, “How are you holding up?” I replied, “OK, so far. I had a quick couple of cries, I’m not gonna lie.” I was pretty calm considering the news I had received to this point.<a href="#foot2" id="ref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> There was no blame to hand out. I didn’t cause it. It just <em>was</em>.</p>

<h3>2025 July 19 (Saturday)</h3>
<p>I learned about the morning rounds on this unit. At about 5 a.m. each day, I saw a Neurology resident who had me give them an update, which they then relayed to the surgeon prior to the larger rounds between 8 and 9 a.m..  Those later rounds only happened during the work week, so it was going to be a couple of days before there would be any significant action other than testing and giving me steroids to reduce the swelling in my brain — and hopefully reduce some of the mental impairment I was feeling, like not being able to reliably tell the time by looking at an analogue watch face or being able to do math in my head quickly that would normally be easy for me.</p>
<p>My wife arrived at the hospital almost exactly a day after I arrived. This was the beginning of what would be the longest time away from home we had ever spent together. (The next longest: our honeymoon.) She quickly became the person managing my care: she coordinated with the insurance company, my employer, and was my <cite>de facto</cite> physical/occupational therapist. She was also my case information manager because I became overwhelmed quickly when I received virtually any level of messaging on a device that I could not read very well (even after I turned on some accessibility features). We asked a few people to act as as a go-between (for my relatives, professional communities, etc.). My wife provided info to them to distribute to those who asked and she took the responses and well-wishes and let me know in  to me in a way and at a time that was appropriate to my condition. I don’t know how I would have managed all of that alone.</p>

<h3>Week of 2025 July 21</h3>
<p>It became clear that the standard of care for my tumour was to have surgery to remove it and receive treatment once I had recovered  from the surgery. The big decision that had to be made — by my health insurance provider, not the doctors I was seeing on site — was where I would have surgery: in the USA or back in Canada. In the end, for what we assumed were liability or expense reasons, they authorized surgery in Hershey. I had a short visit from an Occupational Therapist to help me get working with a cane, related mostly to my vision loss. My wife got me up and walking the hallways, even adding excursions to the cafeteria and an outdoor courtyard. I even crossed the street outside the hospital a few times.</p>

<p>I had the surgery on Friday, July 25. The resection successfully removed 98% of the tumour. I recovered in a post-surgical ward for the rest of the week. My unofficial therapist had me walking the halls, but obviously in proportion to my strength level — after all, I was still recovering from major surgery. I also had a visit from a physical therapist after surgery, who gave me some gentle strengthening exercises. By mid-Sunday, I had been returned to the same wing of the hospital where I had started (essentially, I moved from intensive care back to acute care).</p>
<h3>Week of 2025 July 28</h3>
<p>Very soon thereafter, we started to hear about me being discharged. The only problem was that the hospital was used to discharging people back to their home — we were not only far from home, but we would need permission from insurance to return home. In our case, “discharge” actually meant “fend for yourself.” They still expected me to return for the surgical follow-up a week or so after surgery, so we now had to find somewhere to go that would be suitable for rest and recuperation, ideally within reach of the hospital in case there was any complications. In the end, they were conservative with their discharge plans and we left the hospital on Wednesday, the 30th.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, I went from playing on Easy mode directly to Hard mode, complete with real-world obstacles. My wife had been staying at a very modest Hotel a solid 20 minute walk away from the hospital. We had to go get a cab to the hotel (because I couldn’t yet walk that far), gather up both of our belongings, check out, rent a car, and get to our new “home” while we waited for my follow-up appointment. We got very lucky on that last front.</p>
<p>At the hospital, my wife had heard that there was a “<a href="https://mgmguesthouse.com" target="_blank">guest house</a>” down the highway where people who had to travel in to get treatment at the Hershey Medical Center but couldn’t get back home overnight could stay affordably — the door was open to both the patient and the family member (usually a spouse) who travelled with them. This was particularly useful for people who had a series of treatments on consecutive days. Our case was a bit of an exception, but they were willing to have us stay there while I recuperated and awaited my surgical follow-up visit. This ended up being the perfect situation for us. They provided breakfast for us each day, and we had access to the kitchen so that we could prepare our own meals and within our dietary restrictions (Type 2 Diabetes for me and Gluten Allergy for my wife). We were there for about a week.</p>

<h3>Week of 2025 August 4</h3>
<p>Our follow-up visit with the surgical team was on Monday, where I had a CT Scan and had various other measurements collected. This was when I discovered that I had lost weight through this process — 7-8 kg (15+ pounds). One could make jokes about hospital food at this point, but it was certainly a contributing factor. Mind you, I had never been on steroids to reduce brain swelling before, which also messed up my blood sugars, so I can’t say for sure. I just know I started to increase my normal protein portions after this discovery.</p>
<img src="/images/202509_protein.jpeg" srcset="/images/202509_protein@2x.jpeg 2x" alt="Anthony increasing his protein intake at a restaurant, served a large portion of pork side ribs with sausages."/>

<p>Everything looked good, so the surgical team sent their report to the insurance company and we waited to find out when we would be “repatriated.” As you can imagine, we were eager to get home; the web of friends that we had counted on to manage our home and dog had worked overtime and needed to deal with their own affairs. We had checked out flight options and were ready to leave as soon as the next day out of the nearest airport, Harrisburg. The insurance company, after consulting their medical team, contacted us just after 7 p.m. on Tuesday. Again, based on what can only be assumed to be liability concerns, they insisted that I be escorted by a nurse who had oxygen with them and that the longest part of the journey (a 4-hour leg) would need to support me laying flat. We were told by our case manager that it might be Saturday or Sunday before we would be home. You can imagine our reaction. I was recovering well; I had even walked about 1 km in a park (with a break in the middle) on the Sunday before. These seemed to be ridiculous precautions, but our alternative was to arrange transportation home at our own expense and immediately lose insurance coverage. We opted to accept their transportation home, but we stressed to the case manager that we were concerned about the people holding things together at home and that the decisions of the company kept extending this burden.</p>
<p>In the end, our case manager heard us. They flew a nurse from Montréal to Philadelphia Thursday morning, and she used ground transportation to get to a hotel in  Hershey. We checked in to the same hotel for the Thursday night to simplify logistics for the next leg of the journey. We didn’t get much sleep because our adventure to get home started before 4 a.m. Friday.</p>
<h3>2025 August 08</h3>
<p>The three of us gathered in the lobby at 3:45 a.m. to meet the SUV that the car service had sent to drive us from the hotel to PHL airport. That drive took us about 1 hour and 45 minutes; I had a decent rest in the reclining seat for about half the trip. After checking in with Air Canada<a href="#foot3" id="ref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> and being issued paper tickets (!!), we went through security and grabbed breakfast as we waited for our 9:15 a.m. flight to Montréal. My travelling companions spotted the coin-operated massage chairs and suggested I use them for both their intended purpose and as a good place for yet another nap.</p>

<p>(Are you seeing a pattern emerge?) It worked out really well.</p>
<p>The nurse and I travelled in Business Class for this journey, while my wife had to sit in economy. What we had not realized was that we would be served breakfast in Business Class, but hey, I was trying to gain weight, so it was a bonus.</p>
<p>We cleared customs in Montréal and made it to our flight to Calgary in plenty of time. This was the luxury part of the trip: we were on a 787 with the sleeping pods that I would have loved (but not loved paying for) when flying overseas. Again, the nurse and I got the pods and my wife was stuck in economy beside someone who needed to use the air sickness bag. The flight was over 4 hours, so you can guess what I did for a bunch of that time.</p>
<p>After arriving in Calgary, we picked up our bags, found our car service driver, and were transported to the front door of a house I had left 30 days earlier (since I visited my sister and niece prior to the Conference). We had been away so long, even our beloved miniature poodle had to give us a good sniff to remember who we were! It was good to be home and to have a weekend to recover before we started on the next part of this journey!</p>
<h3>2025 August 11 and beyond</h3>
<p>As Treatment was next on the agenda. We had pulled on what levers we could while I was in Hershey to find out how I could get started with treatment. With help, we were connected to the right people at the brand new Arthur Child Comprehensive Cancer Centre so that we knew where to go on the Monday to get enrolled for treatment, toting a surprising amount of medical files and optical discs with scans. This started a series of appointments and tests that has become my full-time job. Yes, I am on medical leave from work, and I started radiation and chemotherapy (via oral medication, thankfully) about the same time Apple announced new iPhone 17 <cite>et al</cite>. I have enrolled in a Phase 2 Trial that adds Niacin to the regular treatment plan that hopefully will increase efficacy. I have connected to some additional supports, including a group for people who are dealing with a Brain Tumour (because, it seams, once you have one, you will be dealing with it for the rest of your life).  </p>
<h3>Final Diagnosis and Prognosis</h3>
<p>I’ve danced around the medical details to this point because that is how I experienced hearing about them. The one thing I did know early on was that my peripheral vision loss was almost certainly permanent. Otherwise, Medical professionals were careful not to share predictions before more of the data came in on the actual tumour they removed. My wife studied up on brain tumours and had asked questions privately, which gave her more insight about the likely outcome than I. It turned out my tumour was a Glioblastoma. In short, that’s not good news. I am describing my prognosis this way: I will see 2026 unless things go very badly, but things would need to go very well for me to see 2027.</p>
<p>I understand this is not the happy ending any of you were hoping for when you started reading this epic tale. Believe me, it completely sucks to be on this end of it, both for me and my wife.</p>
<p>There are things in my life that are likely done: driving a car, playing on a curling  team, and conducting a community concert band full time. My participation in the international Mac Admins community will be greatly diminished because I won’t be doing the day-to-day work while I am on medical leave (at least through treatment and recovery). So I am in a weird state where I can’t retire because to do so would harm my medical and financial situation, but I still have a full-time job: getting treatment for my cancer. In the early part of this year, I had had started openly talking about retiring in 2026, then more specifically at the end of October 2026, which would have brought my work tenure at the University of Calgary — and as a Mac Admin — to 30 years.<a href="#foot4" id="ref4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. That, too, will not come to pass.</p>
<p>It is depressing to know I will not have “golden years” to enjoy with my wife and friends. Our plans for travel once I was free from my work schedule are now restricted by my treatment schedule, energy levels, and (in-)ability to obtain travel insurance. But I have recovered well from initial surgery, which gives me hope for how well I will be able to rebound from treatment. I went from being an old man to now again being a young, relatively healthy person in this context. My oncologists have been clear that their goal is quality of life, not just longevity. So I will use the finite time I do have (and we <em>all</em> have a finite amount of time in this realm, I just have a better idea of my window) to have golden <em>time</em>. My time at the Mac Admins Conference and the discussions I have had since revealed that I still have things I want to do, things to live for. So that’s what I’m going to do. Wish me luck.<a href="#foot5" id="ref5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<h3>Contact</h3>
<p><cite>To avoid bots and web scrapers from capturing my personal information, you’ll have to do some work assembling the contact info.</cite></p>
<p>If you want to reach out to me (as some of you already have), you are welcome to do so, but understand that responses will be slow and/or succinct, especially while undergoing treatment.</p>
<ul><li>For my Mac Admins friends, the Mac Admins Slack is the best way to reach me (@jazzace), but @mastodon.social (@AnthonyReimer) also works.</li>
<li>For people in the community band scene or the international symphonic band world, email is probably best; all my email addresses end with @jazzace.ca, so you can precede that with <cite>band</cite> for community band or <cite>wasbemail</cite> if you are one of my WASBE friends.</li>
<li>For colleagues at work who want to reach out personally, you can use my work email address for now, but I suggest you substitute @jazzace.ca for @ucalgary.ca, as that address gets directed to a personal emailbox. I won’t be answering questions <em>about</em> work.</li>
<li>I am better able to manage text messages now, so you can text: (a) my current cell/mobile number, (b) my old landline number (I will reply from my current cell number), (c) on an Apple device via Messages using “text@” followed by my domain. I simply ask that you use text messages for brief conversations, not monologues. Sending private messages as if you are making a public post to social media (e.g., “Look at this inspirational thing I just found”) is not appreciated and is likely to overwhelm me.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are in the Calgary area and can help me get to and from appointments (mostly on weekdays) or do the occasional errand or task, I would be most grateful. And wherever you are, I will need emotional support. That includes having <em>real</em> conversations because it doesn’t get any more real than this. Whatever your capacity, whatever your schedule, thanks for considering this./p>
