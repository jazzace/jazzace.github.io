title: Blog Post or Wiki Edit? (üì¶)
---
<p>Last November, I was updating my AutoPkg recipe overrides for the Adobe Creative Cloud applications to reflect the new version year. After having to change multiple variables in multiple recipe overrides to accomplish this, I decided it would be smarter (and less error-prone) to change just one variable in each override each year. So I created a new Input variable for the Version Year and used variable substitution in the other values that required the year. This concept of arbitrary Input variables was only partially documented in the Wiki, and is also important in the Jamf Uploader series of processors. So the question I asked myself was, ‚ÄúDo I blog about this or do I add it to the Wiki?‚Äù This blog post is about the factors I consider when making that choice.</p>
<h3>Where Blogging Shines</h3>
<p>Think about the blogs you tend to visit most. Can you picture what form a post on that blog takes? For example, if you were thinking of Rich Trouton‚Äôs Der Flounder Blog, you would probably think of it as a source of detailed ‚Äúhow-to‚Äù articles. The general concept being covered is established off the top and details come ‚Äúafter the break.‚Äù That is a great use of a blog: as a repository of ‚Äúexternal documentation‚Äù of an issue you encountered (and usually solved at some level). Anything that you think may be useful to a broader audience gets put on the blog instead of just documented internally at your workplace.</p>
<p>My blog has posts like that too, but I tend to take more of a ‚Äústorytelling‚Äù or ‚Äúresearch paper‚Äù approach with my posts. Usually, I had to dig deep into a topic to solve a problem (or to understand the edge cases for a presentation topic) and found out some interesting and often non-obvious (to me) things that I thought were worth sharing. Telling the story of how I got there is often just as helpful as my factual learning.</p>
<p>Another type of post I do is publicly documenting what we learned through discussion, more often than not these days in the Mac Admins Slack. (Remember, an Internet Search will not find any content in the Mac Admins Slack.) Documentation is something I can do to contribute to open source projects I use, freeing up time for the people who do most of the coding. It also makes it more discoverable. Just this week, there was a <a href="https://macadmins.slack.com/archives/C056155B4/p1748904171090899" target="_blank">discussion in the #autopkg channel of the Mac Admins Slack</a> where <a href="https://maclabs.jazzace.ca/2019/11/11/autopkg-input-variables.html" target="_blank">one of these ‚Äúcapture the discussion‚Äù posts</a> was referenced, meaning that instead of someone rewriting or tracking down what we had discussed 5 years ago, they could point to my blog post instead. (I am always thrilled when something like that happens.)</p>
<p>I also use my blog to write pedagogical or ‚Äútopic‚Äù pieces (like the one you are reading right now). Arguably the two posts that got the most traction of all of my writings were of this type: my 2021 post entitled <a href="/2021/07/18/recognition-retirement-remembrance.html" target="_blank">Recognition, Retirement, and Remembrance</a> and my 2013 piece for AFP548, <a href="http://www.afp548.com/2013/05/21/deployment-a-pedagogical-manifesto/" target="_blank">Deployment: A Pedagogical Manifest(o)</a>. In the case of the latter article, I iterated on the ideas there in various presentations I gave after that, trying to give Mac Admins a good way to talk about these things. That thread cumulated in <a href="/2018/02/23/macaduk-slides-and-updates.html" target="_blank">my 2018 Presentation at MacAD.UK</a>, which was an historical overview of how we deployed Macs up until that time, with my final iteration of the workflow diagramme still being conceptually valid today.</p>
<p>Of course, you need to <em>have</em> a blog to post to your blog. <a href="https://pages.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> provides a free and relatively easy way to start one.<a href="#foot1" id="ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> There are definitely benefits for your future employment to having a blog, as it becomes another aspect of your r√©sum√© ‚Äî those companies that value contributing to the Mac Admins community will be particularly interested. But if you don‚Äôt want to do that quite yet, consider asking someone if you can guest post on their blog. Alternately, if you are part of a discussion board that is receptive to long-form posts (<a href="https://community.jamf.com" target="_blank">Jamf Nation</a> would be a prominent example), that is also an option.</p>
<h3>When to Wiki</h3>
<p>At work, I use an internal Wiki to document procedures and policies within my area, particularly those tasks that I only need to do annually and those that get delegated to student staff. Much like Rich‚Äôs blog posts, I set out the premise for the Wiki article and then provide step-by-step instructions. Articles don‚Äôt dig into how we learned it unless it is a troubleshooting article, where documenting the problem is as important as documenting the solution. I even have student staff write Wiki articles when I have to talk them through something that is not currently in the Wiki. By having them do it, they also have a better chance at retaining the new knowledge ‚Äî or at least knowing where to look when the same issue arises again. Stylistically, we are writing not as ourselves but as our organization, so that helps keep the focus on being clear and accurate.</p>
<p>The same principles apply to the Wiki for an open source project. You are writing in the voice of the Project, so how you acquired the knowledge is rarely relevant. It is your job to state the information in a clear and factual manner, ideally in a way that is easy to understand and reference. You also need to accept that your work <em>will</em> be edited. Once you make that commit to the Wiki, that content no longer belongs to you.</p>
<p>The best reason to add to the Wiki of an Open Source project is to make the existing documentation more complete. In the situation I presented at the beginning of this article, I opted for adding to the Wiki because there was already a page about <a href="https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg/wiki/Defining-Custom-Variables" target="_blank">Defining Custom Variables</a> where this could be added, thereby making that page more complete.<a href="#foot2" id="ref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> It made sense to discuss it in the broader context of custom variables, and I could add a distinction between a custom variable in a processor argument and as an Input variable. There were a couple of other small things that made sense to edit at the same time, so I did that as well. In the end, the only part that was best for my blog was the first paragraph of this article. If you want to see the updates I made to that page, you can <a href="https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg/wiki/Defining-Custom-Variables/_compare/a758a8cd3063845441477e5b164f08618a6b7082...6bee4aee26630cf3f5d5c751f728ec65090660cb" target="_blank">compare the most recent commit with the one just before I started that edit</a>. (And yes, I have edited that page more than once prior to that, so my knowledge of that page was also a factor.)</p>
<p>For those who do not (yet) have their own blog, contributing to a Wiki is a good choice as long as you keep that writing style in mind.</p>
<h3>Why not both?</h3>
<p>Sometimes, it makes sense to put content in both a blog post and the Wiki. For the way I use my blog, the story part works best in my blog and the technical information (the end result of my research, if you will) works best in the Wiki. As I get closer to retirement, migrating the content that is still relevant to the related Wiki makes good sense. In fact, I suspect some of my early retirement years will be spent creating modern teaching materials for my favourite Open Source project. It could be standalone (think website or eBook), but it makes sense to add anything I discover in my research to the related Wiki if it doesn‚Äôt already exist there.</p>
<h3>More About Contributing</h3>
<p>In July, Vaughn Miller, Kelly Guimont, and I will be doing a workshop at this year‚Äôs Mac Admins Conference, entitled <a href="https://macadmins.psu.edu/workshops/#865602" target="_blank">Contributing to Our Community</a>. The research we are doing for this workshop is what gave me the idea for this blog post, and I already have other ideas for blog posts coming out of this, since we won‚Äôt be able to cover everything we think is useful. So, to answer the question I posed in the title of this article, the answer is ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù There are many ways to contribute to the Mac Admins community in addition to what I have discussed here, but the important part is to contribute. Hopefully, this post will help you decide if one or both of these methods are a good match for you and your skillset.</p>

It is currently the only theme ‚Äúapproved‚Äù for GitHub Pages that supports auto-switching between Dark Mode and Light Mode. Yes, there is more to discuss here, but it is a topic for another day. Feel free to ask me about it if you attend our workshop. <a href="#ref1">[Return to main text]</a></p>
<p id="foot2">[2] You can always add a new page to the Wiki, but do consider the structure of the current Wiki if it clear that it has been deliberately planned. If the project has a discussion board or is active in the Mac Admins Slack, you can check there if you are uncertain how such an addition might be received. <a href="#ref2">[Return to main text]</a></p>
