title: Lore, Picking a Workplace, and Leadership
---


<p>I listened to <a href="https://podcast.macadmins.org/2025/10/28/episode-434-learning-new-lore-with-kitzy/" target="_blank">Episode 434 of the MacAdmins Podcast</a> and felt I wanted to write a blog-length response to what Kitzy and the hosts were talking about. I resonated with so many things in that discussion, albeit from a different angle sometimes.</p>

<h3> Lore</h3>
<p> <p> There are two places where I am a “keeper of the Lore:” as the solo Mac Admin running the Integrated Arts Media Labs at the University of Calgary, and as the Music Director and Conductor of <a href="https://foothillsconcertband.ca" target="_blank">Foothills Concert Band</a>. I’ve been in each of those roles for over 25 years, so I would be a person who would know why something had been established in the way it was. Sometimes it was related to an overall philosophy that may have not been formally documented, but more often it was because something bad had happened that necessitated a more formal or rules-based process being instituted. Here’s an example from my Band. We had a service concert at a residence for senior citizens. One of our players, who was the only person in the band on their instrument, had missed a few consecutive rehearsals, so we cued the missing part to another instrument. Lo and behold, the player appeared on concert night. What do we do? I didn’t feel I had the authority to say, “no, you can’t play tonight.” So the player took up their spot in the band, unaware that there was a problem. Sadly, missing rehearsals had affected their ability to play the music, and it caused more than one problem during the performance. After that incident, the Board of the band gave the Music Director the power to determine who could, and could not play any particular gig. Looking at that policy in the Policy Manual is easier to understand if you know the “why” behind it.</p>
<p> Also, all my authority in these two roles is delegated. I behave more like a Technical Director or Executive Director, where I make day-to-day operational decisions and have a deep understanding of how we operate. I offer that knowledge as a resource, but if the overarching policy makers (i.e., the Academics at work, the Board of the Band) decide to go in a new direction even being aware of why things are the way they are now, then it is my job to implement the new direction. It’s the same as the Public Servant’s Oath: Fearless advice, Loyal implementation. So I’ve never felt burdened by being the source of historical knowledge. Admittedly, I had to grow into that attitude and not equate Keeper of the Lore with Sole Source of Wisdom. Now, I give more space for others to provide their perspective, even seeking out the thoughts of people who tend to stay quiet. This helps me make better contributions to any discussion and make those discussions solutions-oriented, which in turn reduces the power of “we’ve always done it that way.”</p>
<p>Along the same lines, you may have even noticed that the last number of conference presentations or workshops that I’ve been involved in have been with other people, not solo efforts. The result has been better than what I would have accomplished alone.</p>
<p>One final thought on lore-keeping. As I prepared to retire from my UCalgary position, I focussed on making my internal documentation more robust and explicit. I added some of the rationale and/or historical perspectives — essentially, I documented some of the lore. That is another way to get out of that role should you wish.</p>
<h3>Mission First</h3>
<p> Another interesting thing Kitzy brought up was that they picked their new employer rather than picking a particular role. This resonated with me because most people who choose public service or the charitable sector are doing just that. They believe in the mission, they want to contribute to a greater good, and often set aside more lucrative opportunities to support the mission. I actually lucked in to my Mac Admin career, as I had quit my unsatisfying job in educational music sales to go back to University to pursue a masters in music. While I waited for admission, a position came up at the University that was only guaranteed to exist for a year due to the way it was funded. Where I was standing, that was a feature not a bug, since it would let me pad my bank account before starting grad studies. (That job is essentially the job I have today.) When I started work in that position I was reminded of what I liked about my initial career choice: teaching. I wasn’t worried about how much profit we were making this quarter or any other such capitalist considerations. I wanted to share my knowledge and skills with others. I wanted to give students of any age a better chance for success and provide quality services.</p>
<p> Anyone who works in public education (or for any public institution) knows that they are sacrificing a greater wage for some stability and generally better working conditions (because the sector is more heavily unionized). So it was great to hear from Kitzy that this kind of choosing the employer (or “mission”) is a choice to private sector workers make as well, even if it is uncommon.</p>
<h3>Leadership Kinds</h3>
<p>The final thing in this wide-ranging discussion I wanted to chime in on is the idea of leadership without having a formal Manager or Team Lead role. As I was listening to the episode, I realized that the way I lead most often is a way that Kitzy does as well: what I call being an instigator.<a href="#foot1" id="ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> An instigator sees a need or a better path and takes some sort of action, even if it is only first steps, like starting a discussion. Sometimes, things happen quickly; sometimes it is a slow burn, where the idea gains greater acceptance over time or leads to a related but even better idea. There are also failures (or what seem like failures at the time), so acceptance is a part of being an instigator, but being persistent is also common.</p>

<p>In Kitzy’s case, they were the co-instigator of the Mac Admins Slack, something that hit the right note at the right time to expand exponentially, beyond the vision of the creators. Instigating is a recurring theme for me, in the Mac Admins context. I was the guy who started an annual Mac support meeting at my University to bring together people who were mostly siloed in their Department or Faculty and were generally not part of IT, as IT was not only Windows-centric but actively Mac-hostile until the iPhone came along. Once I started attending conferences, I realized that we needed more of that info sharing here and I started talking about hosting a conference. It took a number of years for the circumstances and the people to align, but when it happened, it came together quickly and the MacDeployment Conference was born. Ironically enough, my original vision — that we needed to bring all this excellent knowledge closer to home to disperse it — ended up being surpassed by something I didn’t see initially but will be obvious to people who regularly attend any of the long-running conferences: the creation of a community. While the last time we held the MacDeployment Conference was online in 2021, the local community that was created still exists and we gather every year to watch the WWDC Keynote.</p>
<p>Not sure if you are a leader? Think you might be a leader but you are not in that role? I recommend you check out a presentation from the most recent Mac Admins Conference by Meghan Gillet of Walt Disney Animation Studios (yes, Greg Neagle’s boss). It was entitled “<a href="https://youtu.be/wtaMPmLUqck" target="_blank">Leading From Wherever You Are</a>.” Whether you are an instigator or not, you are certain to find something that resonates with you. Make sure you do the in-session exercise; it made me realize what I still wanted to do professionally. My circumstances changed dramatically the day after Meghan gave that talk, but the information I garnered from that exercise has helped me prioritize what I can still contribute to the community.</p>

<p id="foot1">[1] I have also described this kind of leader as an initiator or a catalyst, but I think instigator has that extra implication that the action is not a straightforward, “just flip the switch” kind of leadership. <a href="#ref1">[Return to main text]</a></p>
