title: Video of MacAD.UK Presentation Now Online
---
<p>Courtesy of the <a href="https://www.macad.uk" class="website" target="_blank">MacAD.UK Conference</a> organisers, you can watch a video of the presentation I gave in London in February:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/jwFSbCkd39A" target="_blank">Deployment: We Need To Talk</a> [Video on YouTube]</li></ul>
<p>A couple of notes on the video:</p>
<ul><li>You may see a cut in the video about 12 seconds in. If you do, the only thing you miss me saying is, “welcome to the second half of the Canadian doubleheader.” I said that because <a href="https://youtu.be/oFPIbLSGdYU" target="_blank">Diana Birsan presented an excellent session</a> just before me in the same room. It's possible that the video will be updated with the missing 3 seconds.</li>
<li><a href="/2018/02/23/macaduk-slides-and-updates.html">In my previous blog post,</a> I provided a couple of updates to the content in the video. A link to the slide deck is also there.</li></ul>
<p>Here’s hoping most of you are moving towards Post-imaging Era practices.</p>
