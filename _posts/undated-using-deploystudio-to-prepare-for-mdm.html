title: Using DeployStudio (one last time) to Prepare for MDM Deployments
---
<p>I admit it. I am experiencing a bit of #MacAdminShame in authoring this post. Apple has clearly stated to those of us deploying Macs professionally to “select an MDM vendor.” Your ability to manage certain settings and deploy certain kinds of software will get smaller and smaller without it. We selected an MDM vendor some time ago at my workplace but none of my Macs were enrolled in Apple School Manager (formerly DEP) prior to last week. For technical reasons I won’t get into here, none of the Macs I manage are currently in our MDM either. (That will almost certainly change over the summer, but we’re OK with the related network restrictions that brings for now.)

<p>Let me introduce you to the Anthony Reimer matrix for Mac Admin Pain as we go through the transition from the Automation Era to the Installation Era:</p>

    <li>All software and settings to be deployed installed on a “Golden” Mac, then disk image made of that Mac and image deployed to all other Macs in fleet.</li>
