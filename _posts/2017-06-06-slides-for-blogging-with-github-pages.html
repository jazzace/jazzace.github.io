title: Slides for Blogging with GitHub Pages
---
<p>I'm providing the slides and notes for the segment on <cite>Blogging with GitHub Pages: A Step-by-step Guide on How to Fail</cite> as part of the larger "Sharing What We've Learned" workshop by Vaughn Miller and I. Note the style contrast between this presentation and an outline-style segment of our workshop.</p>
