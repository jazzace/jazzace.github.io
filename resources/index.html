title: Presentations and Other Resources
---
<p>This page is designed to share resources that I have created or co-created. Most commonly, presentations given at various Mac admins conferences will have their slide decks and/or handouts posted or linked here. Articles posted on external sites as well as those self-published prior to the creation of my <a href="/index.html" target="_blank">Mac Labs Blog</a> (in 2017) are also included in the list.</p>
