title: The Mac Hardware/Software Obsolescence Chart
---
<p>In trying to sort out what Mac hardware supported which operating systems and what new features, it became useful to create a chart to help visualize it. Since I didn't have a current copy of <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle">OmniGraffle</a> handy at the time, I made a 1920Ã—1080 slide in <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/keynote/id409183694">Keynote!</a> That was 2012; I have regularly updated it since then.</p>
<p>The text colour associated with each model indicates the last supported operating system that Mac can run:</p>
<ul><li>Black text = current and announced versions of macOS (e.g., Sonoma)</li>
<li><font color="D4550F">Orange text</font> = Ventura (macOS 13)</li>
<li><font color="773F9B">Purple text</font> = Monterey (macOS 12)</li>
<li><font color="B91109">Red text</font> = Big Sur (macOS 11)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use the icons along the top (placed chronologically) to see what the minimum version of macOS is that you can use on each Mac (generally, the one that it shipped with). The chart also marks the earliest machines in each line that support AirDrop, AirPlay Mirroring, Bluetooth 4.0, Handoff (and a number of other features listed on the Legend page that require the same minimum hardware), Auto Unlock, Universal Control, AirPlay to Mac, and <a href="/2018/12/01/colour-deep-and-wide.html" target="_blank">10-bit Colour</a> (a.k.a. Deep Color, 1 Billion Colours). If you need specific details, may I suggest <a href="https://mactracker.ca">Mactracker</a> (another Made in Canada/Alberta resource!) or <a href="https://support.apple.com/specs" target="_blank">Apple Tech Specs</a>. Note that Education-only models do not appear in the chart. The Xserve line is similarly omitted.</p>

<p><cite>Updated 2023-09-25 to add the new MacBook Pro (15-inch M2), Mac Studio, and Mac Pro, plus macOS Sonoma compatibility information. Some image masking cleanup was also done.</cite></p>
