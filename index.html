<h1>Anthony Reimer’s Blog for Mac Admins</h1>
<p>This is the start of my blog for Mac Admins, focusing on things that may be of interest to those who run Labs like I do.</p>
<p>For my older presentations and posts, visit my <a href="http://ucalgary.ca/iaml/help/pro" target="_blank">Resources for Mac IT/AT Professionals</a> page at the University of Calgary. That's also where you’ll continue to find my <a href="http://ucalgary.ca/iaml/help/pro/hwswchart" target="_blank">Mac Hardware/Software Obsolescence Chart</a>.</p>
<p>For all my other personally-created content, go to my <a href="http://jazzace.ca/">personal web site</a> (Established 1996).</p>
