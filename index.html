<h2>Mac Hardware/Software Obsolescence Chart</h2>
<p>This chart stopped being maintained shortly after the release of macOS 26. You may <a href="/resources/hwswchart">view the final release</a> or, if you prefer, <a href="https://github.com/jazzace/MacObsolescence" target="_blank">download or fork the source from GitHub</a> (with all my internal documentation) and update it yourself, as it has been dedicated to the Public Domain as much as possible.</p>
<h2>Other Personal</h2>
<p>For other personally-created content, go to my <a href="https://jazzace.ca/">personal web site</a> (Established 1996), also linked at the top of each page.</p>
